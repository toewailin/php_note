### Core Base Structure for Laravel Projects

For your various projects—website project, online shop, online learning, POS, and e-commerce—using Laravel, it’s best to create a modular and scalable core base structure that allows for reusability. Below is a core Laravel base structure that can be customized for each project.

---

## 1️⃣ Core Base Structure for Laravel Projects

This base structure will serve as a foundation for all your projects, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and modularity.

### 📂 Folder Structure
```
/my-laravel-project
│── app/
│   ├── Http/
│   │   ├── Controllers/
│   │   ├── Middleware/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── Services/
│   ├── Repositories/
│── bootstrap/
│── config/
│── database/
│   ├── factories/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── seeders/
│── public/
│── resources/
│   ├── views/
│   ├── lang/
│── routes/
│── storage/
│── tests/
│── vendor/
│── .env
│── artisan
│── composer.json
│── package.json
│── vite.config.js
```

## 2️⃣ Core Components for Reusability

These components ensure that your Laravel projects can be extended without rewriting major parts.

### 🛡️ Authentication & User Management
- Use Laravel Breeze, Jetstream, or Laravel UI for user authentication.
- Implement Roles & Permissions (e.g., Spatie Laravel Permissions) for different user types:
  - **Admin**
  - **Customer**
  - **Instructor** (for e-learning)
  - **Cashier** (for POS)
  - **Seller/Vendor** (for e-commerce)

### 🗄️ Database Design (Common Models)

| Model | Common Fields |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| **User** | name, email, password, role_id, avatar |
| **Role** | name, permissions |
| **Product** (for shop/POS) | name, description, price, stock, category_id |
| **Order** (for shop/POS) | user_id, total_price, status, payment_id |
| **Category** | name, description |
| **Payment** | user_id, order_id, method, transaction_id |
| **Course** (for learning) | title, description, price, instructor_id |
| **Lesson** (for learning) | course_id, title, video_url, content |
| **Transaction** | user_id, type (purchase, refund, subscription) |

Each project will extend or modify these base models.

## 3️⃣ Project-Specific Core Customization

- Order Management
- Payment Gateway Integration (Stripe, PayPal)
- Reviews & Ratings
- Inventory Management
- Coupons & Discounts

## 4️⃣ API & Microservices (For Scalability)

To ensure that all projects can be extended into mobile apps or third-party integrations, you should have:
- **API Routes** (`routes/api.php`)
- **Laravel Sanctum** (for authentication)
- **Separate Admin & User API**
- **Swagger for API Documentation**

### 🔗 Example API Routes
```php
Route::prefix('api')->group(function () {
    Route::post('/login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);
    Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->group(function () {
        Route::get('/user', [UserController::class, 'profile']);
        Route::get('/products', [ProductController::class, 'index']);
    });
});
```

## 5️⃣ Admin Panel

For all your projects, Laravel Nova or Filament can be used to create an admin dashboard.
- **Admin Dashboard** for Managing Users, Orders, Courses, etc.
- **Analytics & Reports**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

---

## 6️⃣ Deployment Strategy

Since all projects will be using Laravel, the deployment process should be standardized:
- **Use Laravel Forge/Vapor** for server management
- **Queue workers** for background tasks
- **Load balancing** for high-traffic e-commerce or learning platforms
- **CDN for media handling** (images, videos)

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

By using a **modular Laravel core structure**, you can reuse many components across projects while keeping them flexible for e-commerce, POS, online learning, and websites.
