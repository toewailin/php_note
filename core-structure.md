For your various projects—website project, online shop, online learning, POS, and e-commerce—using Laravel, it’s best to create a modular and scalable core base structure that allows for reusability. Below is a core Laravel base structure that can be customized for each project.

1. Core Base Structure for Laravel Projects

This base structure will serve as a foundation for all your projects, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and modularity.

Folder Structure

/my-laravel-project
│── app/
│   ├── Http/
│   │   ├── Controllers/
│   │   ├── Middleware/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── Services/
│   ├── Repositories/
│── bootstrap/
│── config/
│── database/
│   ├── factories/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── seeders/
│── public/
│── resources/
│   ├── views/
│   ├── lang/
│── routes/
│── storage/
│── tests/
│── vendor/
│── .env
│── artisan
│── composer.json
│── package.json
│── webpack.mix.js

2. Core Components for Reusability

These components ensure that your Laravel projects can be extended without rewriting major parts.

2.1 Authentication & User Management
	•	Use Laravel Breeze, Jetstream, or Laravel UI for user authentication.
	•	Implement Roles & Permissions (e.g., Spatie Laravel Permissions) for different user types:
	•	Admin
	•	Customer
	•	Instructor (for e-learning)
	•	Cashier (for POS)
	•	Seller/Vendor (for e-commerce)

2.2 Database Design (Common Models)

Your projects will share these core models:

Model	Common Fields
User	name, email, password, role_id, avatar
Role	name, permissions
Product (for shop/POS)	name, description, price, stock, category_id
Order (for shop/POS)	user_id, total_price, status, payment_id
Category	name, description
Payment	user_id, order_id, method, transaction_id
Course (for learning)	title, description, price, instructor_id
Lesson (for learning)	course_id, title, video_url, content
Transaction	user_id, type (purchase, refund, subscription)

Each project will extend or modify these base models.

3. Project-Specific Core Customization

Each project has unique features. You can extend the core structure by adding specific functionalities.

3.1 Online Shop (E-Commerce)
	•	Product Variants (e.g., color, size)
	•	Shopping Cart & Wishlist
	•	Order Management
	•	Payment Gateway Integration (Stripe, PayPal)
	•	Reviews & Ratings
	•	Inventory Management
	•	Coupons & Discounts

3.2 Online Learning Platform
	•	Courses & Lessons
	•	Instructor Dashboard
	•	Student Progress Tracking
	•	Live Classes & Video Hosting
	•	Quizzes & Certifications
	•	Subscription System (for paid courses)

3.3 POS System
	•	Barcode Scanner Support
	•	Sales Reports & Analytics
	•	Cashier Dashboard
	•	Multi-Store Support
	•	Discounts & Receipts
	•	Offline Mode & Syncing

3.4 General Website
	•	CMS for Content Management
	•	Blog System
	•	Contact Form
	•	SEO Optimization
	•	Newsletter Subscription

4. API & Microservices (For Scalability)

To ensure that all projects can be extended into mobile apps or third-party integrations, you should have:
	•	API Routes (routes/api.php)
	•	Laravel Sanctum (for authentication)
	•	Separate Admin & User API
	•	Swagger for API Documentation

Example:

Route::prefix('api')->group(function () {
    Route::post('/login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);
    Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->group(function () {
        Route::get('/user', [UserController::class, 'profile']);
        Route::get('/products', [ProductController::class, 'index']);
    });
});

5. Admin Panel

For all your projects, Laravel Nova or Filament can be used to create an admin dashboard.
	•	Admin Dashboard for Managing Users, Orders, Courses, etc.
	•	Analytics & Reports
	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

6. Deployment Strategy

Since all projects will be using Laravel, the deployment process should be standardized:
	•	Use Laravel Forge/Vapor for server management
	•	Queue workers for background tasks
	•	Load balancing for high-traffic e-commerce or learning platforms
	•	CDN for media handling (images, videos)

Conclusion

By using a modular Laravel core structure, you can reuse many components across projects while keeping them flexible for e-commerce, POS, online learning, and websites.
