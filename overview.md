Sure, I can guide you through learning PHP with Laravel step by step. Here’s how we’ll structure the learning journey:

Basic PHP Fundamentals
 1. Setting Up Your Environment
 • Install PHP, Composer, and a local development server (e.g., XAMPP, Laravel Valet, or Homestead).
 • Install a code editor like VS Code or PHPStorm.
 2. Understanding PHP Basics
 • Variables, Data Types, and Operators.
 • Control Structures: if, else, switch, for, foreach, while.
 • Functions: Creating and using functions.
 • Arrays: Associative, indexed, and multidimensional arrays.

 • Working with forms: GET and POST methods.
 • Handling sessions and cookies.
 • Uploading and validating files.
 4. Object-Oriented PHP
 • Classes and Objects.
 • Inheritance and Polymorphism.
 • Namespaces and Traits.

Laravel Basics
 1. Setting Up Laravel
 • Install Laravel via Composer: composer create-project laravel/laravel myapp.
 • Understand the folder structure.
 2. Routing
 • Define routes in routes/web.php and routes/api.php.
 • Route parameters, middleware, and named routes.
 3. Controllers
 • Generate controllers: php artisan make:controller MyController.
 • Passing data to views.
 4. Views with Blade
 • Blade syntax: @if, @foreach, @include.

 • Query scopes and accessors/mutators.
 • Database seeding and factories.
 2. Authentication
 • Laravel Breeze or Jetstream for authentication scaffolding.
 • Customizing authentication logic.
 3. API Development
 • Build RESTful APIs.

Advanced Laravel
 1. Advanced Query Building
 • Using joins, subqueries, and advanced filters.
 • Query optimization techniques.
 2. Event and Listener
 • Using Laravel’s event system to decouple functionalities.
 3. Queues and Jobs
 • Process time-consuming tasks using queues.
 • Configure and use Laravel Horizon.
 4. Testing
 • Writing unit and feature tests with PHPUnit.
 • Mocking dependencies and testing APIs.
 5. Performance Optimization
 • Use caching for queries and views.
 • Optimize database interactions.

Final Project
 1. Build a full-stack application like a blog, e-commerce system, or API service.
 2. Deploy the application using Laravel Forge or manual methods.
